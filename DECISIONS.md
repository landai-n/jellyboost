# DECISIONS.md — divergence & decision log

Governance rule (see `docs/PLAN.md`): every non-trivial implementation decision is checked
against the plan. Any divergence is recorded here **before or with** the diverging change.

## Entry template

## 2026-07-28 — Media3 pinned to 1.9.0 (ffmpeg-decoder pairing)
- **Scope:** `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `:player`
- **Plan said:** Media3 1.10.1 **iff** `org.jellyfin.media3:media3-ffmpeg-decoder` has a matching build, otherwise pin down to the newest version with a matching decoder.
- **Done instead:** Media3 `1.9.0` + `media3-ffmpeg-decoder 1.9.0+1` (latest published decoder; verified on Maven Central 2026-07-28; 1.9.4 exists for Media3 but has no decoder build). Not pairing decoder 1.9.0+1 with Media3 1.9.4 because the decoder links against Media3-internal APIs that are not guaranteed patch-stable.
- **Reason:** This is the plan's own prescribed fallback; recorded here because the concrete version differs from the number written in the plan.

## 2026-07-28 — Pre-approved design choices (marked [D] in the plan)
Seeded from the approved plan; listed for traceability, no divergence:
- minSdk 26 (not 21).
- Single `ItemEntity` table with structured columns + `BaseItemDto` JSON blob (not Findroid's 4 typed tables).
- `DownloadEntity` primary key = itemId (one download per item).
- Download pipeline: OkHttp + WorkManager + Room (not system `DownloadManager`).
- Default download storage: app-private `getExternalFilesDir(null)/downloads`; SAF/SD optional; storage-location change only when no downloads exist (MoveStorageWorker deferred).
- Hardware-probed DeviceProfile (jellyfin-android style), NOT Findroid's permissive "direct play all" profile; external-player and web-codec code paths dropped.
- Offline browse scope: downloaded items only (cached parents of downloaded items still open).
- User-data sync conflict: most-recent-wins (compare `lastPlayedDate`/`updatedAt`).
- Navigation: bottom nav bar (Home / Libraries / Search / Downloads), Settings behind avatar.
